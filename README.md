# Tower-Of-Hanoi-C--Animation
Tower of Hanoi is a popular game in which there are n disks of different disks and 3 towers. The disks are placed on one of the tower in such a way that smaller disk is always above the bigger one. The task is to shift all disk to another tower with the help of 3rd one. There are only two rules that you can not place bigger disk over smaller and the disks can be moved one at a time. Here is a sample animation in Blender and C++ code.
